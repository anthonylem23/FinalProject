    <p> We are small business that originated from the small northern Indiana city of South Bend, the home of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. We offer photography and videography work across all sorts around the South Bend and Indianapolis area. We offer services such as senior photos, family photos, professional photos, along with video work as well that may consist of graduations, birthday parties and even weddings. Photos and videos not only create a memory, but they also create a feeling and tell a story of what may have occurred or the message that is intended to be portrayed.
    </p>
    <p> We began this small business as a high school hobby and began taking photos for high school proms and senior photos, where the connections grew bigger and the relationships became more mutual. We strive to create a both a collaborative and collective relationship with the client as we want the client to have a memorable experience and to have fun! This small business is intended to maintain an affordable service that can provide the client with satisfactory outcomes and an experience to remember. Photos can always remind someone of an experience, feeling, person, or a time in their life with a story.
